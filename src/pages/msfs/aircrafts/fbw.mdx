# FlyByWire Installer

FlyByWire is the pioneer of freeware in Flight Simulator, most known for their A32NX project and the upcoming A380X.


## Installation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Difficulty:** Easy
</Callout>

This installation guide will help you install their installer which has been made to install and update their aircraft.

<Steps>

### Run the installer

Download the [installer](https://flybywiresim.com/) and then run it normally via [Protontricks](/msfs/protontricks).

Once the installer has completed, the FlyByWire Installer will open up; this can be used normally.

### (Optional) Create a Desktop Entry for PMDG Operations Center

Creating a [desktop entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html)
should make opening FlyByWire Installer easier as you will not have to find the location manually each time.

These files will go into `~/.local/share/applications/`, but you can create multiple directories inside it to make it
easier to manage your custom Desktop Entries that you manually created. For example on my system, I stored this entry
under

```
~/.local/share/applications/
```

Create a Desktop Entry inside a location specified above, with a text editor of your choice. The name of the file is
irrelevant as long as it has the `.desktop` extension.

```desktop copy filename="flybywire-installer.desktop"
[Desktop Entry]
Name=FlyByWire Installer
Exec=protontricks -c "wine C:/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Programs/fbw-installer/FlyByWire\\ Installer.exe" 1250410
Type=Application
StartupNotify=true
Categories=Game;Simulation;
```

Then make sure to update the database for desktop entries by running this command in the terminal

```shell copy
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

You should now be able to find FlyByWire Installer in your Desktop Environment's application launcher.

### (Optional) Add icon to Desktop Entry

Adding an icon is quite easy, we just have some extra steps on what we have already done.

First we need to go to this location:

```
<your drive>/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Programs/fbw-installer/resources/extraResources/
```

Here you will find a copy of the `icon.ico` file containing the FlyByWire Installer icon.

Sadly this will not work on Linux and we will have to convert it into a png file.

To do that, you need to install ImageMagick, and then run this command in the same location mentioned above:

```
magick icon.ico icon.png
```

After we have done that, you just have to edit your `flybywire-installer.desktop` file by adding this line:

```
Icon=<your drive>/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Programs/fbw-installer/resources/extraResources/icon.png
```

</Steps>

The aircraft and FlyByWire Installer should work on Linux now. Enjoy flying your aircraft in the simulator!
